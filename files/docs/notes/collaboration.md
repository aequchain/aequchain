# Collaboration Notes

These notes capture the creator's non-negotiable principles and practical preferences so every contributor stays aligned.

## Core Principles
- **Universal Access:** Anyone who can prove they are a real person must be able to join without paying fees, staking, or purchasing tokens.
- **Equality First:** The system must always guarantee one share per person. No feature may introduce unequal rewards, mining incentives, or fee extraction.
- **Living for Free Trajectory:** All engineering choices should support the long-term goal of making essentials (food, shelter, energy, healthcare, education) freely available within the network.
- **Scalable Scope:** The protocol must work for communities of any size—from a local cooperative to the entire planet—while preserving the same equality guarantees.
- **Reward-Free Admission Work:** Any anti-spam mechanism (formerly “PoW”) is purely for rate control, never for financial reward.

## Communication Preferences
- Keep explanations clear and approachable; assume the reader can understand technical details when presented logically.
- Explicitly note whether changes affect persistence or remain in-memory/ephemeral.
- When adding features, document both the “what” and the “why” so intent is always traceable.
- Proactively surface next steps and risks so progress never stalls.

## Engineering Checklist for New Work
1. Verify that free admission and equal share logic remain intact.
2. Confirm no new monetary incentives were introduced.
3. Explain how the change advances the living-for-free path or future scalability.
4. Run a quick validation (tests, build, or targeted check) and record the result.
5. Update relevant docs so future contributors understand the change in context.

Staying aligned with these guidelines keeps the project faithful to its mission: an equitable, moneyless system that anyone can join and that scales to all world currencies.
